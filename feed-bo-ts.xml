We look at what the data have to say about measuring leadership, and its impact on the economy and the country.

Bill Gates is one of those people for whom “needs no introduction” is actually true. The polymathic Microsoft founder now leads the world’s largest and most important private foundation, and he’s predicting that we’re on the cusp of the energy breakthrough that’s going to save the world.
